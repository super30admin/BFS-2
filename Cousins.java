/**
 * In a binary tree, the root node is at depth 0, and children of each depth k
 * node are at depth k+1. Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have 
 * the same depth, but have different parents.
 * 
 * We are given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and the values x
 * and y of two different nodes in the tree. Return true if and only if the nodes
 * corresponding to the values x and y are cousins.
 * 
 * Idea is to perform traversal of the tree and keep track of depth and parent.
 * When we see either x or y as child of u, we track the depth and its parent.
 * 
 * Space Complexity: O(n), for bfs queue
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * 
 * Leetcode Attempts: 2
 * 
 * Leetcode Results: Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 69.82% of Java online
 * submissions for Cousins in Binary Tree. Memory Usage: 34.5 MB, less than
 * 100.00% of Java online submissions for Cousins in Binary Tree.
